Rasel brought professional and top notch web design skills to the team. His talent, dedication and willingness to go the extra mile set him apart from his peers. For instance, in "Project Windows/Grameenphone eCare", we were chasing a very ambitious deadline. Rasel took the challenge and single-handedly designed the whole website, making sure that every aspect of the site meets user experience standards and exceeds business expectations. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rasel, in his own volition, was working at clients premise to make sure that he captures the feedback and solve issues immediately. Rasel is a great asset to any team and I'm sure that we will have only great things to hear about him in near future.</blockquote><span>â€” Rupok Kadir, Delivery Project Manager (MBA MACH) at <strong>Microsoft</strong></span><blockquote>Rasel is a Product Designer with a unique set of skills spanning both UX and Front End. He is able to conceptualize user flows and interactions and see them through prototyping or creation of production-ready scaffolds. He is a hard worker who can meet difficult deadlines and has made numerous contributions to the success of our Dhaka office. He would be a valuable member of any development team in need of design expertise.</blockquote><span>â€” Rohun Gholkar, Product Manager&nbsp;at <strong>Facebook</strong></span><blockquote>Rasel Mahmud and I worked on two different projects, Smart Gallery and Content Marketing Cloud. He was the UX designer on those projects, and his contribution was highly appreciated. On several occasions, I found myself taking his advice on how the user experience of a particular feature will be like. He is deeply passionate about his work. When it comes to work, he gives nothing but the best and expects nothing but the best from his colleagues. I wish him success in his future endeavors.</blockquote><span>â€” Rahbirul Rubayeet, Senior Software Engineer at <strong>Shopify</strong></span><h3>Conferences &amp; Courses Certification</h3><ul><li>Behance Mentor (Product Design)</li><li>Learning REST APIs</li><li>Foundations of Product Ownership</li><li>Certified ScrumMasterÂ®</li><li>Microsoft Certified professionalÂ®</li></ul><h3>Education</h3><ul><li>Bachelor of business administration(BBA)</li><li>TDIP (Math and Computer)</li></ul><h3>Thank you</h3><small>Â©2021 S.
